According to 24-year-old Lara, that's common for her and others on mental health hospital wards in the UK.

Lara is 18 months into a hospital admission and says she's experienced inadequate access to products, a lack of sanitary bins and being watched as she changed a tampon.

When she posted about her experience online, people from across the country responded with their own similar stories.

Mental health hospitals have various rules in place for safety reasons.

These can include limited access to certain items, restrictions on patients leaving wards and lists of what visitors can bring in.

NHS guidance states that period products should be available to anyone who needs them.

Lara says this hasn't always been the case for her.

"I've had a number of hospital admissions to psychiatric units and on one of my first they confiscated my period products," she says.

Lara says she has heavy periods, and when she needed to replace a tampon after two hours staff wouldn't give her another one.

She describes that as "humiliating".

Lara's currently on one-to-one observations for her own safety, which means someone has to escort her to the toilet and watch her change a pad or tampon.

But she says her worst experience was when she's had to wear anti-ligature clothing - again for safety reasons.

"I was forced to remove my pants and sanitary pad - which meant I just had to bleed into the clothing," she says.

"I understand the need for safety to come first, but this experience was unhygienic, traumatising and embarrassing for people to see."
